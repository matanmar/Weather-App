# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The projects doing few things that related to weather forecasting.
first its gets user location (vie geolocation) and show current weather conditions.

There is a tub to show 5 days weather + by clicing on specific ther is a popup (created with react portal) with hourly weather.
Inserted chart (with chart.js) for a few paramteres like wind, temp and pop.

because I like to play  beach volleyball, I coded another tab at the header that dispaly rather the weather is good to play or not (depnding on wind speed color the days in the cahrt with green or red).

pressing on the weather forecast logo will get you back to homepage.

for the weather data I used 'openweathermap' API.
charts- Chart.js.
location- Geolocation.
